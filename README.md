The goal of this project is to create first web application.
We will implement some features to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.
After 4 months, we will have a complete web application composed by:

- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
## The command interpreter
### Execution
The command interpreter can be launched in interactive or non-interactive mode as follows:
* Interactive Mode: `$ ./console.py`
* Non-interactive Mode: `$ echo <command> | ./console.py`

### Usage
